# The Diamonds Dataset

1. The `diamonds` dataset is part of the `mosaic` library.

2. We can access the dataset by loading the `mosaic` library and usign the `data` function.

```R
# install mosaic package
install.packages("mosaic")

# load mosaic package
library(mosaic)

# access diamonds dataset
data(diamonds)
```

3. The `diamonds` dataset includes the following variables.
- `price`: price in U.S. dollars
- `carat`: weight of the diamond
- `cut`: quality of the cut (`Fair`, `Good`, `Very Good`, `Premium`, `Ideal`)
- `color`: diamond color, from `J` (worst) to `D` (best)
- `clarity`: a measurement of how clear the diamond is from `I1` (worst), `SI1`, `SI2`, `VS1`, `VS2`, `VVS1`, `VVS2` to `IF` (best)

4. The dataset also includes five physical measurements (see figure below): `depth`, `table`, `x`, `y`, and `z`

IMAGE

5. We can use `dim()` to get the dimensions of the diamond dataset, 53940 rows and 10 variables.
```R
dim(diamonds)
```

6. We can use `str()` to view the names of the variables.
```R
str(diamonds)
```
